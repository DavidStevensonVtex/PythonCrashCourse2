# Chapter 18: Getting Started with Django

## Specification

We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they're
interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log
home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or login. Once
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read and
edit existing entries.
